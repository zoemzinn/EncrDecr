Using the OpenSSL library of cryptographic functions, the myCrypto.c file symmetrically encrypt and decrypt plaintext from both a buffer and a file descriptor using the Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode. The genKey.c file generates random 256-bit keys and 128-bit initial vectors and outputs them to binary files.
